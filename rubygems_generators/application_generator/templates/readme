How to create a Generator (Application Generator)
======================================

1. DONE - Run the generator: script/generate application_generator myapp
2. Using the generated test class, assert what directories, files, classes etc should
   be generated.
3. Add these files into the app_genearators/myapp/templates folder. Your files can use
   ERb (that is, <%= ... %>).
4. Specify who the files in /templates are copied/templated at generation time within
   app_genearators/myapp/myapp_generators.rb's #manifest method.
   Use m.file for files to copy over.
   Use m.template for files containing ERb. Create attr_reader accessors for any variables 
   your templates need access to.
5. Run unit tests.
6. If your application generator uses other generators (called 'dependencies')
    e.g. (m.dependency "generator-from-rubygems", [arg1, arg2], options)
   then you must add this generators' scope into the executable bin/myapp.
   For example, if you wanted to use a rubygems and/or rails generator, then 
   replace the use_application_sources! call in bin/myapp:

      RubiGen::Base.use_application_sources! :rubygems, :rails

   Without this, RubiGen will not be able to find your dependent generators.
7. Update your Manifest.txt with the new files (rake manifest:refresh)
8. Build and install your RubyGem locally. Run: rake install_gem
9. Go to a directory where you can create new test apps.
10. Run 'myapp [path]' and your application skeleton will be created.
